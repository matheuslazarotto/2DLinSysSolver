## 2D Linear System Solver

This code runs and plots the numerical solution for a given 2D linear dynamical system.

# Instructions:
All settings must be given from the bash `bash_run.sh` file

Set matrix coeffientes in variables [A11, A12, A21, A22].
 
Set phase-space interval window to show (initial conditions are taken inside this window) in variables [x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max]
 
Set number of initial conditions along each axis [Nx, Ny]
 
In case any change to `main.cpp` code is made, the flag [compile] must be selected as `true`.
